          <p>
            I am currently attending University of Califonia - Davis, and
            majoring in Computer Engineering for my Bachelor's. While being a
            full-time student during the year I make sure to always do personal
            projects whenever I get the time to. Whether if it is editing my own
            personal website, making a simple Android application or being apart
            of the Space and Satellite System's Club at Davis. When I am not
            working on my personal projects I love to hit the gym, play some
            basketball/videogames, or learn other new arts such as Jiu Jitsu.

          <h3>Engineering For Kids</h3>

          <p>
            During this experience I learned how to hone my voice and lead a
            class full of energized children. I was expected to clean and
            organize the clasrooms and keep a daily log of what I did throughout
            the day. I was given the opportunity to teach a variety of
            engineering subjects such as Mechanical, Aerospace, Electrical, etc.

          <p>
            As a site coordinator, my responsibilites were to manage about a few
            children at a time and tutor them. The children's grade level were
            from K-12 and I needed to adapt accordingly. I learned skills such
            as patience, communication, and being able to explain a complex
            topic to someone that is younger than me. While tutoring I was also
            given the responsibility to manage my site where I was tutoring,
            making sure everything was organized and ready for the children to
            walk in.
